# Difference between session and JWT
| Aspect            | JWT | Session |
|-------------------|-----|---------|
| Storage           | Stored on client-side (usually browser's localStorage/cookie) | Stored on server (server memory or database) |
| Scalability       | Easier to scale (token carries all data, server is stateless) | Harder to scale (server must share session data) |
| Authentication Type | Stateless authentication | Stateful authentication |
| Server Load       | Server doesnâ€™t store anything â€” just validates token | Server must store session info for each user |
| Security          | JWT can also be stolen (must protect it!), but payload is base64 encoded | Session ID can be stolen if not secured (e.g., XSS, CSRF) |
| Expiration        | JWT has built-in expiration time (exp claim) | Session typically expires after inactivity |
| Revocation (Logout) | JWT cannot be revoked easily until it expires, unless extra logic | Server can immediately invalidate session |
| Typical Use Case  | APIs, mobile apps, SPAs (Single Page Apps) | Web applications (classic login sessions) |

## Session
- When you log in, server creates a session ID.
- This ID is stored in your browser cookie.
- Server stores a matching session object (with user info) in memory or DB.
- Every new request, the browser sends session ID, server checks it.
ðŸ§  Good for traditional web apps (Spring MVC, JSP, Thymeleaf projects).
## JWT
- When you log in, server creates a JWT token.
- This token contains user data and is signed with a secret key.
- Client stores it (like in localStorage or a cookie).
- Every new request, client sends the token in the Authorization Header.
- Server validates the token's signature â€” no session checking!
ðŸ§  Perfect for REST APIs, microservices, mobile apps.
