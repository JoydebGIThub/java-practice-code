# Q: What is Spring Boot? How is it different from Spring Framework?
Ans: Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring Framework that simplifies the process of building stand-alone, production-ready Spring applications.
It removes boilerplate configurations and auto-configures many things behind the scenes.
ðŸ”¹Spring = Flexible but requires a lot of manual configuration (XMLs, JavaConfig).
ðŸ”¹Spring Boot = Opinionated defaults, embedded servers (Tomcat/Jetty), production-ready with almost zero configuration.

# Q: What are the advantages of using Spring Boot?
Ans: Spring Boot makes it easy to create production-grade, stand-alone Spring applications with minimal setup, using embedded servers, auto-configuration, starter dependencies, and production-ready monitoring.
Spring Boot simplifies Spring application development by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers like Tomcat, starter dependencies for quick setup, and production-ready features like health checks via Actuator.
It reduces boilerplate code, supports microservices, manages multiple environments easily with profiles, and speeds up both development and testing.
***********
# Q: What is starter dependency in Spring Boot?
Ans: Starter dependencies are pre-defined dependency bundles provided by Spring Boot to simplify Maven configuration.
They group together commonly used libraries for a specific functionality, so you donâ€™t have to manually specify each individual dependency.
## If you want to build a web application, instead of manually adding:
1. Spring MVC
2. Tomcat
3. JSON libraries (like Jackson)
### You just add one starter:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>

```
