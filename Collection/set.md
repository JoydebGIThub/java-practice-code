# Set Interface in Java
The Set interface in Java is part of the java.util package and represents a collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Sets are also unordered, meaning they donâ€™t guarantee any specific order of elements. The Set interface extends the Collection interface and is primarily used to model mathematical sets where uniqueness is the key feature.

## Common Implementations of Set Interface in Java:
1. HashSet
   -
   - Description:
     - Implements the "**Set**" interface using a "**hash table**" (backed by a HashMap).
     - It is the most commonly used Set implementation and does "**not guarantee the order**" of elements.
   - Key Features:
     - No Duplicates: Ensures no duplicate elements.
     - Unordered: Elements are stored in no particular order.
     - Constant time performance for basic operations (add, remove, contains), assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly.
     -  We can add null as a value
```java
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
set.add("Apple");
set.add("Banana");
set.add("Apple");  // Duplicate, will not be added
System.out.println(set);  // Output: [Apple, Banana] (order may vary)

```
2. LinkedHashSet
   -
   - Description:
     - Extends HashSet but "**maintains insertion order**". It uses a doubly linked list to maintain the order in which elements are inserted into the set.
   - Key Features:
     - Order-preserving: Maintains the order of insertion (the order in which elements were added).
     - No Duplicates: Ensures uniqueness of elements.
     - Slightly slower than HashSet because of the additional overhead of maintaining the order.
     - We can enter null as a value
```java
Set<String> set = new LinkedHashSet<>();
set.add("Apple");
set.add("Banana");
set.add("Apple");  // Duplicate, will not be added
System.out.println(set);  // Output: [Apple, Banana] (insertion order preserved)


Set<Integer> set = new LinkedHashSet<>();
set.add(1);
set.add(2);
set.add(1);  // Duplicate, will not be added
set.add(null);
System.out.println(set);  // Output: [1, 2, null] (insertion order preserved)
```
3. TreeSet
   -
   - Description:
     - Implements Set using a red-black tree structure, which is a type of self-balancing binary search tree.
     - Sorted: Elements are stored in ascending order by default, or according to a provided Comparator.
   - Key Features:
     - Sorted Order: Maintains a natural ordering of elements or the ordering defined by a comparator.
     - No Duplicates: Ensures uniqueness of elements.
     - Provides log(n) time complexity for basic operations (add, remove, contains).
     - we can't add null as a value.
```java
Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
set.add(3);
set.add(1);
set.add(2);
set.add(1);  // Duplicate, will not be added
//set.add(null);// Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
System.out.println(set);  // Output: [1, 2, 3] (sorted in natural order)
```
