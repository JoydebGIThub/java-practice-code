## WHat is the dependency injection and how spring boot support it?
Ans: Dependency Injection is a **design pattern** where an **object receives other objects** that it depends on (its dependencies) from an **outside source rather than creating them itself**. In simpler terms:   
- Dependency: An object that another object needs to function correctly.
- Injection: The act of providing those necessary dependent objects to the dependent object.
- Outside Source: Typically a framework or a dedicated configuration system.
Think of it like this: Instead of a car manufacturing its own engine, wheels, and seats, a DI framework acts as a supplier, providing these pre-built components to the car factory. The car factory then just needs to assemble them.
### How Spring Boot Supports Dependency Injection:
Spring Boot, built on top of the **core Spring Framework**, has first-class support for Dependency Injection and makes it incredibly easy to use. Here's how it works: 
1. **Spring Container (Application Context)**: At the heart of Spring's DI mechanism is the Spring container (also known as the Application Context). This container is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the application's beans (objects) and injecting their dependencies. Spring Boot automatically sets up and manages this container for you.
2. Beans: In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and are managed by the Spring container are called beans. You define how these beans should be created, configured, and their dependencies injected
3. Dependency Injection Mechanisms in Spring: Spring offers several ways to perform dependency injection:
   - Constructor Injection: Dependencies are provided as arguments to the constructor of a class. This is the recommended approach as it makes dependencies explicit, ensures that required dependencies are available upon object creation, and facilitates testing. You use the @Autowired annotation (or, in many cases, it's implicit for single-constructor classes) on the constructor.   
```java
@Service
public class UserService {

    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    @Autowired // Optional for single-constructor classes
    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    // ... methods using userRepository ...
}
```

## Q: What is circular dependency and how spring boot handle it
Ans: A circular dependency occurs when two or more beans in a Spring application directly or indirectly depend on each other. Imagine Bean A needing Bean B, and Bean B needing Bean A. This creates a cycle in the dependency graph.
```java
@Service
public class ServiceA {

    private final ServiceB serviceB;

    public ServiceA(ServiceB serviceB) {
        this.serviceB = serviceB;
    }

    // ... methods using serviceB ...
}

@Service
public class ServiceB {

    private final ServiceA serviceA;

    public ServiceB(ServiceA serviceA) {
        this.serviceA = serviceA;
    }

    // ... methods using serviceA ...
}
```
In this scenario, to create ServiceA, Spring needs ServiceB, but to create ServiceB, Spring needs ServiceA, leading to a **chicken-and-egg problem**.
Circular dependencies can also be **indirect**, involving more than two beans: **A -> B -> C -> A**.
### How Spring Boot Handles Circular Dependencies:
Spring provides mechanisms to handle certain types of circular dependencies, primarily through early exposure of **singleton beans**. Here's how it generally works:
1. **Early Bean Reference**: When Spring is creating a **singleton bean**, if it **encounters a dependency on another singleton bean** that is also currently being created (part of a circular dependency), Spring can provide an **early reference** to the first bean before it's fully initialized. This early reference is essentially a pointer to the partially created object.
2. **Proxy Creation**: Spring often uses **proxies** (especially with AOP) to manage bean dependencies. In the case of circular dependencies, it might **create a proxy for one of the beans** involved in the cycle and inject this proxy into the other bean. The actual object of the proxied bean will be **fully initialized later**.
3. **Constructor Injection Limitations: Spring's ability to resolve circular dependencies is primarily limited to setter injection and field injection. It generally cannot resolve circular dependencies between beans that are solely dependent on each other through their constructors. This is because Spring needs to fully construct the bean before it can inject dependencies via the constructor. If two beans need each other in their constructors, Spring gets stuck**.
4. **Setter and Field Injection as a Workaround (Use with Caution)**: Spring can often resolve circular dependencies if you use setter or field injection for at least one of the beans in the cycle. When Spring creates the first bean, it can set a reference to the second bean (even if the second bean isn't fully created yet, potentially using a proxy). When the second bean is being created, it can similarly have a reference set back to the first.
```java
@Service
public class ServiceA {

    private ServiceB serviceB;

    @Autowired
    public void setServiceB(ServiceB serviceB) {
        this.serviceB = serviceB;
    }

    // ... methods using serviceB ...
}

@Service
public class ServiceB {

    private ServiceA serviceA;

    @Autowired
    public void setServiceA(ServiceA serviceA) {
        this.serviceA = serviceA;
    }

    // ... methods using serviceA ...
}
```
#### Best Practices for Handling Circular Dependencies:
1. Refactor Your Code: The best solution is to break the circular dependency by restructuring your classes and their responsibilities. Consider if the two classes are doing too much and if their responsibilities can be separated into new, independent classes.
2. Introduce an Intermediate Service: Create a third service that encapsulates the shared logic or interaction between the two originally dependent services. The original services can then depend on this new service without creating a cycle.
**Spring can handle some circular dependencies, especially those involving setter or field injection, by using early bean references and proxies. However, constructor-based circular dependencies typically lead to errors. The best approach is to avoid circular dependencies altogether through careful design and refactoring to create a more loosely coupled and maintainable application.**

## Q: There are many repository in spring boot can you tell me the difference between JpaRepository and CurdRepository
**CrudRepository**:
  - Part of: Spring Data Commons. It's a core interface that provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for any data source that Spring Data supports (not just JPA).
  - Focus: Provides fundamental data access methods in a generic way.
  - Key Methods:
    - save(S entity): Saves a given entity.
    - saveAll(Iterable entities): Saves all given entities.
    - findById(ID id): Retrieves an entity by its ID. Returns an Optional.
    - existsById(ID id): Returns true if an entity with the given ID exists.
    - findAll(): Returns all entities.
    - findAllById(Iterable<ID> ids): Returns all entities with the given IDs.
    - count(): Returns the number of entities available.
    - deleteById(ID id): Deletes the entity with the given ID.
    - delete(T entity): Deletes a given entity.
    - deleteAll(Iterable<? extends T> entities): Deletes the given entities.
    - deleteAll(): Deletes all entities.
  - Return Types: Often uses Iterable for collections.
  - Features: Primarily focused on basic CRUD. Doesn't include JPA-specific features or advanced querying options out of the the box.
  - Use Case: Suitable for simple data access needs where you only require basic CRUD operations and want to keep your repository interface more abstract and potentially usable with different data sources in the future (though in practice, if you're using Spring Data JPA, you'll likely lean towards JpaRepository).
**JpaRepository**:
  - Part of: Spring Data JPA. It's an interface specifically designed for JPA (Java Persistence API) based data access layers.
  - Inheritance: JpaRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository, which in turn extends CrudRepository. This means JpaRepository inherits all the methods of CrudRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository.
  - Key Methods (in addition to CrudRepository):
    - findAll(Sort sort): Returns all entities sorted by the given Sort object.
    - findAll(Pageable pageable): Returns a Page of entities meeting the paging restriction provided in the Pageable object. This provides built-in pagination.
    - flush(): Flushes all pending changes to the database.
    - saveAndFlush(S entity): Saves an entity and immediately flushes the changes to the database.
    - deleteInBatch(Iterable<T> entities): Deletes the given entities in a batch, which can be more efficient than deleting them individually.
    - deleteAllInBatch(): Deletes all entities in a batch.
    - getReferenceById(ID id): Returns a reference to the entity with the given identifier. **The entity is not fully loaded until its properties are accessed (lazy loading)**.
    - It also includes methods from QueryByExampleExecutor (if you implement it), allowing for querying by example.
  - Return Types: Can use List and Page in addition to Iterable.
  - Features: Includes everything in CrudRepository plus:
    - Pagination: Built-in support for retrieving data in pages.
    - Sorting: Easy retrieval of data in a specific order.
    - JPA-specific methods: Like flush(), saveAndFlush(), deleteInBatch(), and getReferenceById().
    - Query by Example: Through the QueryByExampleExecutor interface (often implemented by JpaRepository).
**JpaRepository is a more powerful and feature-rich interface that extends CrudRepository (and PagingAndSortingRepository). It provides all the basic CRUD operations plus functionalities specifically tailored for JPA, such as pagination, sorting, and batch operations. In most Spring Boot applications dealing with relational databases through JPA, JpaRepository is the preferred and more convenient choice.**

## Q: What are the best practices for tuning the performance of the spring boot application?
1. JVM Tuning:
   - **Choose the Right JVM and Version**: Different JVMs (like HotSpot, OpenJ9, GraalVM) and versions can have varying performance characteristics. Research and choose the one that best suits your application's workload. Newer versions often include performance improvements.
2. Spring Boot Specific Optimizations:
   - **Lazy Initialization (@Lazy)**: For beans that are not immediately required, use @Lazy to defer their initialization until they are first accessed. This can significantly reduce application startup time.
   - **Profile-Specific Configurations**: Use Spring Profiles (@Profile, application-{profile}.properties/yml) to have different configurations for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production). This allows you to enable more aggressive optimizations in production.
   - **Optimize Data Access**:
     - Caching: Implement caching at various levels (e.g., using @Cacheable from Spring's caching abstraction, or using a dedicated caching solution like Redis or Memcached) to reduce database load for frequently accessed data.
    - **Asynchronous Operations (@Async)**: For long-running, non-blocking tasks, use @Async to execute them in a separate thread pool, freeing up resources for handling incoming requests. Configure your TaskExecutor appropriately.
    - **Monitoring and Profiling**:
      - Actuator: Leverage Spring Boot Actuator endpoints (/metrics, /health, /threaddump, /heapdump) to monitor your application's health and performance in production.
      - Profiling Tools: Use profiling tools (e.g., JProfiler, YourKit, VisualVM) in development and staging environments to identify performance bottlenecks (CPU usage, memory leaks, slow database queries).
    - **Dependency Management**: Keep your dependencies lean and avoid including unnecessary libraries that can increase application size and startup time.
    - **Code Optimization**: Write efficient code, avoid unnecessary object creation, use appropriate data structures, and optimize algorithms for performance-critical sections.
