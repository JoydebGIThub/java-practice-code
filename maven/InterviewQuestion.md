# What is Maven Build Lifecycle?
Maven Build Lifecycle is a well-defined sequence of phases that define the process of building a project, from the initial compilation to the final deployment of artifacts. It allows you to automate and manage the build process for Java projects in a structured and consistent way.
A lifecycle in Maven consists of a sequence of phases, and each phase represents a step in the build process. Maven provides three built-in lifecycles:
- Default Lifecycle
- Clean Lifecycle
- Site Lifecycle
1. Default Lifecycle
   -
This lifecycle is responsible for the actual project deployment and contains the main phases for building your project. The default lifecycle consists of the following key phases:
- validate: Validates the project structure and checks if all required information is available (such as proper configuration files).
- compile: Compiles the source code of the project.
- test: Runs the unit tests to validate the correctness of the code.
- package: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format like JAR, WAR, or EAR.
- verify: Verifies that the package is valid and meets all quality criteria (e.g., integration tests).
- install: Installs the packaged artifact (JAR, WAR) into the local Maven repository, making it available for other projects on the local machine.
- deploy: Deploys the packaged artifact to a remote repository, such as Maven Central or a private repository for use by other developers and systems.
### Maven Build Phases Execution Order:
Phases are executed in a specific order within their respective lifecycles. 
For example, when you execute the mvn install command, Maven will run the following phases in the default lifecycle:
- validate
- compile
- test
- package
- verify
- install

# What is settings.xml in Maven?
settings.xml is a configuration file in Maven that provides global or user-specific configuration settings for Maven projects. It is typically used to configure settings that affect the behavior of Maven at the build or runtime level. The file is not a part of the project, but rather exists in the Maven installation directory or the user's home directory.
There are two locations where settings.xml can be found:
1. Global settings.xml:
   - Located in the MAVEN_HOME/conf/ directory (where Maven is installed).
   - This file contains settings that apply to all Maven users on the system.
2. User-specific settings.xml:
   - Located in the ~/.m2/ directory (in the user's home directory).
   - This file contains settings specific to the individual user, which overrides the global settings.
