# Interview Therory Question:
## Q: Explain the Java Memory Model (JMM) and the happens-before relationship
```
Java 🧠Memory Model (JMM) is a specification that defines how threads 🧵 in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interact with 🧠memory. It governs how and when different threads 🧵can see 👁️values written to shared variables by other threads 🧵 and provides rules for 🧠memory operations such as reads and writes. The JMM aims to ensure that muiltithreaded 🧵🧵 programs behave correctly across different hardware architectures by abstracting away the underlying complexities of processor caches and memory hierarchies.
```
### Key aspects of the JMM include:
- Main Memory: This is the central memory🧠 area where all variables reside.
- Working Memory: Each thread 🧵 has its own working memory 🧠, which is a cache of the main memory. Threads 🧵operate on these local copies ©️.
- Memory Operations: The JMM defines operations like reading 📖 from and writing 📓to main memory🧠 and working memory, as well as locking 🔒 and unlocking 🔓.
- Synchronization Primitives: Keywords like "synchronized" and "volatile" are part of the JMM and provide mechanisms for controlling memory🧠 visibility and preventing 🐎race conditions.

```
The "happens-before" relationship is a fundamental concept within the JMM. It's not about the actual order 🔢of execution but rather a set of rules 📏the guarantee the visibility 👁️of the results of one operation to another.
If one action happens-before another, then the first 🥇 action's result is guaranteed to be visible 👁️ to the second 🥈action. This relationship is crucial for ensuring the correctness ✔️of concurrent programs.
```
### Here are some key rules that establish happens-before relationships:
1. Program Order Rule: Within a single thread 🧵, each action in the program happens-before every action that comes later 🔚in the program order.
```java
int x = 10; //Action A
int y = x*2;// Action B
//Here, action A happens-before action B
```
2. Monitor Lock Rule: An unlock 🔓 operation on a monitor lock 🔒 happens-before every subsequent lock 🔒opeartion on the same monitor.
```java
synchronized(lock){
  //Action A
}// Unlock
synchronized(lock){
  //Action B will see the effect of Action A
}//Lock
```
3. Volatile Variable Rule: A write 📓 to a "volatile" field happens-before every subsequent read 📖 of the same field.
```java
volatile int counter = 0;
//Thread 1
counter = 1; //write

//Thread 2
int value = counter; //Read will see the value 1
```
4. Thread Start Rule: A call 🤙 to Thread.start() 🧵 on a thread 🧵 happens-before any action in the started thread 🧵.
```java
Thread t= new Thread(()=>{
  int data= 42;//Action A in the new thread
});
//...
t.start();// Happens-before Action A
```
5. Thread Join Rule: All actions in a thread 🧵 happen-before any other thread 🧵successfully returns from a "Thread.join()" on the thread.
```java
Thread t= new Thread(()=>{
  //Some action
});
t.start();
t.join(); //The effects of actions in t are visible after join returns
```
6. Transitivity: If action A happens-before action B, and action B happens-before action C, then action A happens-before action C.
