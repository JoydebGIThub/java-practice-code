# Interview Therory Question:
## Q: Explain the Java Memory Model (JMM) and the happens-before relationship
```
Java 🧠Memory Model (JMM) is a specification that defines how threads 🧵 in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interact with 🧠memory. It governs how and when different threads 🧵can see 👁️values written to shared variables by other threads 🧵 and provides rules for 🧠memory operations such as reads and writes. The JMM aims to ensure that muiltithreaded 🧵🧵 programs behave correctly across different hardware architectures by abstracting away the underlying complexities of processor caches and memory hierarchies.
```
### Key aspects of the JMM include:
- Main Memory: This is the central memory🧠 area where all variables reside.
