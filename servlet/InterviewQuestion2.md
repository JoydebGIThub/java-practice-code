# Q: What is the difference between doGet() and doPost()?
| Feature         | doPost() | doGet() |
|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Primary Purpose | Primarily used to submit data to the server for processing. | Primarily used to retrieve data from the server. |
| Data Transmission | Data is usually sent in the body of the HTTP request. | Data is typically appended to the URL as query parameters. |
| Data Visibility | Data is not visible in the URL, offering better security for sensitive information. | Data is visible in the URL, making it less suitable for sensitive data like passwords. |
| Data Length | Generally, there are no strict limitations on the size of the request body, making POST suitable for larger data payloads. | There are limitations on the length of the URL, so GET requests are not ideal for sending large amounts of data. |
| Idempotency | POST requests are not necessarily idempotent. Submitting the same POST request multiple times might have different effects (e.g., creating multiple identical records). | GET requests are expected to be idempotent. Making the same GET request multiple times should have the same result as making it once. |
| Caching | Responses to POST requests are generally not cached by default. | Responses to GET requests can be cached by browsers and intermediaries (like proxies) to improve performance. |
| Bookmarking | POST requests generally cannot be bookmarked in a meaningful way. | GET requests can be bookmarked in the browser, allowing users to easily return to the same resource with the same parameters. |
| HTTP Method | Corresponds to the HTTP POST method. | Corresponds to the HTTP GET method. |
